Docker Architecture Flow:

Frontend (S3/CloudFront):
Static files (images, HTML, JS) → CloudFront → S3 or Dockerized frontend containers (ECS/Kubernetes).

CloudFront:
Delivers static content (or containerized frontend) to end users.

Application Load Balancer (ALB):
Routes incoming traffic to backend services (either EC2 instances or Docker containers running on ECS/Kubernetes).

Backend (Dockerized EC2 instances or ECS/Kubernetes):
The Docker containers host your backend application.
The application handles user requests, processes data, and interacts with databases or caches.

RDS (Database):
The backend containers interact with RDS to store and retrieve data as needed.

ElastiCache (Caching):
Optional: Dockerized Redis/Memcached is used to cache frequently accessed data to reduce database load.

CloudWatch:
Monitoring the performance of EC2, RDS, ElastiCache, and Docker containers.
